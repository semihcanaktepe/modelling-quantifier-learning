# Probabilistic Modelling of Quantifier Learning
This repository includes the probabilistic modelling of quantifier learning using the probabilistic programming language, WebPPL. This langauge is the extension of JavaScript in which probabilistic programs and algorithms can be implemented. For this project, this language is utilized to model an agent that learns some unnatural quantifiers using the information provided.
